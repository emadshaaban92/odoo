                                            <li>every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</li>
                                            <li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”</li>
                                            <li>there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”</li>
                                            <li>we are being asked an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”</li>
                                            <li>it is a rant disguised as a question: “______ sucks, am I right?”</li>

                                        <p>If you fit in one of these example or if your motivation for asking the question is “I would like to participate in a discussion about ______”, then you should not be asking here but on our mailing lists. However, if your motivation is “I would like others to explain ______ to me”, then you are probably OK.</p>

                                        <p>When a question or answer is upvoted, the user who posted them will gain some points, which are called "karma points". These points serve as a rough measure of the community trust to him/her. Various moderation tasks are gradually assigned to the users based on those points.</p>
                                        <p>For example, if you ask an interesting question or give a helpful answer, your input will be upvoted. On the other hand if the answer is misleading - it will be downvoted. Each vote in favor will generate 10 points, each vote against will subtract 10 points. There is a limit of 200 points that can be accumulated for a question or answer per day. The table given at the end explains reputation point requirements for each type of moderation task.</p>
