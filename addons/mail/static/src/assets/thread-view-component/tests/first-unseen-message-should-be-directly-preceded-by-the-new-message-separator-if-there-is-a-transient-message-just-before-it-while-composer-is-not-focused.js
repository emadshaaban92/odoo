                The goal of removing the focus is to ensure the thread is not marked as seen automatically.
                Indeed that would trigger set_last_seen_message no matter what, which is already covered by other tests.
                The goal of this test is to cover the conditions specific to transient messages,
                and the conditions from focus would otherwise shadow them.
